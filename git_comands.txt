############################# BASICS #############################
#
#  - There are 3 steps for modifying/syncing with the "origin" (the files on
#    https://github.com)
#
#    1) STAGING: recognizing new files and changes to existing files
#
#    2) COMMITTING: Committing those changes to a "version"
#
#    3) PUSH/PULLING: Pulling other people's changes to your local "repo"
#                     Pushing your own changes to the origin
#

# Check if you have git installed
git --version

# Check if you have any new files/changes made, and whether you're synced with
# the "origin"
git status

# Show any changes you made
git diff

# Add files/changes to staging (files must be staged before they're committed)
git add <list of your files>

# Add every change you made to the repo
git add -A

# Remove a <file> from tracking
git reset <file>

# Commit changes to a version, you need to add a message to say what you did
git commit -m "<your message>"

# Pull the most recent version from the remote reop
git pull origin master

# Push your changes to the remote repo
git push origin master

# Clone a remote repo (you already did this)
git clone <url> </local/file/path/cloned/to/>

#   There's some other stuff we might not end up using but if we do
#   We can add it here
#
#   For instance, if we royally screw something up then we can easily
#   revert back to the last commit that worked
